我有三宝，持而保之：一曰慈，二曰俭，三曰不敢为天下先。
I have three precious gifts that worthy safekeeping and long-term practicing. The first is the kindness; the second is simplicity and frugality; the third is yielding the first-taker position.
慈故能勇；俭故能广；不敢为天下先，故能成器长。
Kindness leads to bravery; simplicity and frugality lead to generosity; yielding the first-taker position grants a leading status.
今舍慈且⑨勇；舍俭且广；舍后且先；死矣！
Forsaking kindness while attempting bravery, forsaking frugality while attempting generosity, taking firstly while trying to lead -- any of these actions will lead to death.
夫慈，以战则胜⑩，以守则固。
