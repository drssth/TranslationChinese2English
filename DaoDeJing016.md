# 我来翻译道德经之016 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 016

## 原文

致虚极，守静笃。
万物并作，吾以观复。
夫物芸芸，各复归其根。
归根曰静，是谓复命；复命曰常，知常曰明。
不知常，妄作凶。
知常容，容乃公，公乃全，全乃天，天乃道，道乃久，没身不殆。

## English

When I banish all noises in mind and heart, I am able to keep the tranquility and peacefullness in life and soul.
Then, everything starts to grow vigorously and I am able to observe their changing trajectory and trends.
All beings grow and multiply, and aligned with the ultimate rule.
Been aligned with the ultimate rule indicates peace. Peace means re-creation of life.
Re-creation of life is the way of nature. Understanding the way of nature is wisdom.
(However,) Ignorance of the way of nature implies omen or disaster.
(On the contrary,) Understanding of the way of nature brings harmony and order. 
Harmony and order bring justice. 
Justice brings completeness and fairness in every aspect. 
Completeness and fairness in every aspect is descended from heaven. 
Descended from heaven is the ultimate rule; thus, it lasts forever and will not perish.
