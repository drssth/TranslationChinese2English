# 我来翻译道德经之055 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 055

含德之厚，比于赤子。
We say the best virtue is like a newborn.
毒虫不螫，猛兽不据，攫鸟不搏。
The poisonous bugs do not bite them. 
The ferocious beasts do not snatch them.
(I think this statement is at least partially true because there are animal-raised children in this world.)
The plunderous birds do not harm them.
骨弱筋柔而握固。
They have soft bones and weak tendon, yet they hold things in their hands firmly.
未知牝牡之合而朘作，精之至也。
They know nothing about sex yet their male organs can get excited, which is because of the pure energy in their bodies.
终日号而不嗄，和之至也。
They cry all day but do not have hoarse voices, which is because their bodies are in pure harmony. 
知和曰常，知常曰明，益生曰祥，心使气曰强。
Knowing harmony indicates having the common sense. Understanding the common sense implies having the wisdom. Boosting lives means auspiciousness. Directing energy with hearts reveals strength.
物壮则老，谓之不道，不道早已。
Everything declines (grows ''old'') when they achieve their summits, which is because they have not aligned with the ultimate rule for a long period of time already.
