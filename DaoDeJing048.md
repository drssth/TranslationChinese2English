# 我来翻译道德经之048 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 048

为学日益，为道日损，损之又损，以至于无为。
People are gaining knowledge when they grow older.
However, they are losing the alignment with the ultimate rule when their hourglass runs.
Losing the alignment with the ultimate rule leads to the lack of satisfaction and accomplishment. (Thus, there are so many people regretting about life on their death beds.)
无为而无不为，取天下常以无事；及其有事，不足以取天下。
The lack of satisfaction and the sense of achievement makes people lose the judgment of the righteousness and the boundary of doing things. The world is still governed orderly if no disaster occurs. However, if a catastrophe happens, it will not be enough to govern the world.
