# 我来翻译道德经之025 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 025

## 原文

有物混成，先天地生。
寂兮寥兮，独立而不改，周行而不殆，可以为天地母。
吾不知其名，强字之曰：道，强为之名曰：大。
大曰逝，逝曰远，远曰反。
故道大，天大，地大，人亦大。
域中有四大，而人居其一焉。
人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。

## English

There is one thing that formed from chaos before the heaven and the earth.
It is silent, independent of other forces and never changes. 
It cycles in periods and never ends. 
It is the mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name. I shall name it as "dao" -- the trajectory of all, the ultimate rule, the way of heaven. I shall give it a surname as "grand".
The surname "grand" indicates it functions and never ends. It never ends functioning so that it reaches far beyond (the world we are limited in). The far distance (in time and space) it reaches makes it returns to and governs the origin of this world.
Therefore, the "dao" is "grand"; and so is the heaven; so is the earth, so are the human beings.
We say that there are four "grand beings" in this world and one of them is human.
The human learns, follows, and absorbs the rules according to the earth. 
The earth follows and absorbs the rules from heaven. 
The heaven follows and absorbs the rules from "dao" -- the ultimate rule.
The ultimate rule -- dao -- follows and absorbs itself and sources from nature.
