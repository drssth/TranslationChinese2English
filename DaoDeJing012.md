# 我来翻译道德经之012 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 012

## 原文

五色令人目盲，
五音令人耳聋，
五味令人口爽，
驰骋畋猎，令人心发狂，
难得之货，令人行妨。
是以圣人，为腹不为目，故去彼取此。

## English

Too many colors would make our sights blind;
Too many sounds would make our hearing deaf;
Too many flavors would make our tastes numb;
Release too much of our desires would drive us crazy.
The rare goods are tempting people to do bad deeds.
Therefore, the saints desire a full stomach but not luxury entertainments; 
thus they have principles for doing and not doing.
