## English

People should be sensitive and mindful on received praises and criticizes, and value setbacks the same as their lives.

How to be sensitive and mindful on praises and criticizes?
Praises are the low-end benefits. 
We are sensitive and mindful on them when we receive them, while at the same time we are sensitive and mindful when we do not receive them. Both together is to be sensitive and mindful on praises and criticizes.

Why to value setbacks the same as our lives?
The reason that we have setbacks is because we are flesh and we live our lives. 
If we are not flesh and do not live our lives, how could we have setbacks in our lives?

To extend this idea, we should value and respect this world the same as we value and respect ourselves (because our existence originated from this world and now depend on this world) and we should take care of this world. We should love this world the same as we love ourselves and we should take responsibilities of this world.
