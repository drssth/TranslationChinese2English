# 我来翻译道德经之054 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 054

善建者不拔，善抱者不脱，子孙以祭祀不辍。
The good constructors know the limits and would not go beyond it.
The good guardians are more careful and never allow negligence.  
Thus, their descendants live with a continuous worship of the ancestors.

修之于家，其德乃余；
The derived virtue is abundant if applying such a concept to the family.
修之于乡，其德乃长；
The derived virtue is nourishing if applying such a concept to the hometown.
修之于邦，其德乃丰；
The derived virtue is harvestable if applying such a concept to the nation.
修之于天下，其德乃普。
The derived virtue is generalized if applying such a concept to the world.
故以身观身，以家观家，以乡观乡，以邦观邦，以天下观天下。
Thus, I see the true self of the others with their rules; I see the true nature of other families with their rules; I see the true communities of the regions with their rules; I see the governing of the nations with their rules; I see the majesty of this world with their rules.
吾何以知天下然哉？以此。
How do I know the truth of this world? Because I use their rules (that define their limits and negligence).
