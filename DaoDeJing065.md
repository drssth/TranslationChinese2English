# 我来翻译道德经之065 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 065

古之善为道者，非以明民，将以愚之。
Those who were good at Daoism in the ancient times were ruling to keep the people pure and simple and not educating them towards cleverness and complicity.
民之难治，以其智多。
People are hard to govern when they are clever to find out various small details and to bypass tiny cracks.
故以智治国，国之贼；
Thus, ruling with cleverness will result in theft and cheating in a nation.
不以智治国，国之福。
In contrast, not governing with cleverness will result in happiness and harmony.
知此两者，亦稽式。
People who understand the two types of governing will also understand the importance of humility and humbleness.
常知稽式，是谓玄德。
Those who understand humility and humbleness are aligned with the grand virtue.
玄德深矣，远矣，与物反矣，然后乃至大顺。
The grand virtue is fundamental and has long-term influences. But it is the opposite of many things. We can only rest in peace if we keep the grand virtue inside us.
