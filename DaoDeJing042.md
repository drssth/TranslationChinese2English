# 我来翻译道德经之042 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 042

道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。
The ultimate rule generates the one; the one splits into the two sides (the binary representative yin and yang); the two sides produce into the three stages (the beginning, the flipping/tipping point, and the ending). The three stages multiply into every existence.
万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和。
All beings turn their backs towards (but rely on) yin (the hidden, the storage, the inside, the negative, etc.) while facing (embracing) yang (the apparent, the consuming, the outside, the positive, etc.). 
They unit the opposite sides into their harmony.
人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以为称。
Such as people despise the 'single person', 'person lost the other half', and 'the one with no child'; yet the lords and kings refer themselves as such.
故物或损之而益，或益之而损。
Therefore, things will be improved if they are damaged; they will also be damaged if they are well-developed.
人之所教，我亦教之。
I shall teach others the same way I was taught.
强梁者不得其死，吾将以为教父。
Those who force their ways will fail and lose their standing. 
I shall use it as the principle of teaching.
