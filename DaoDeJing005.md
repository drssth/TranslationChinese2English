# 我来翻译道德经之005 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 005

## 原文

天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；
圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。
天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？
虚而不屈，动而俞出。
多闻数穷，不若守于中。

## English

If heaven and earth do not have mercy, then all lives on earth would be their sacrifice.
If saints do not have mercy, then all the people on earth would be their sacrifice.
Does the space between the heaven and earth not like a wind tube for a stove?
It is hollow and it does not subdue; the fire grows when you make it move.
Therefore, too much information would confuse people and people should rather keep their inner peace.
