# 我来翻译道德经之070 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 070

吾言甚易知，甚易行。
My words are simple and easy to apply.
天下莫能知，莫能行。
However, it is rarely understood and implemented in this world.
言有宗，事有君，夫唯无知，是以不我知。
We should speak in a manner that follows the guidelines of speech. We should direct our actions following the beneficial principles. Only those who are not wise or knowledgeable cannot understand my words.
知我者希，则我者贵。
Those who understand my words are rare. Those who apply my words are noble.
是以圣人被褐而怀玉。
The above is the reason how saints wear simple clothes but have hearts as priceless as jade.
