# 我来翻译道德经之076 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 076

人之生也柔弱，其死也坚强。
People are born with soft bodies; their flesh becomes hard after they die.
草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。
Plants grow from tender sprouts; their death also results with dry and hard tissue.
故坚强者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒。
Therefore, the hardness and firmness attributes are associated with death while the tenderness and softness are with birth.
是以兵强则灭，木强则折。
Therefore, the strong troops will be destroyed; the hardwood trees will be broken.
强大处下，柔弱处上。
Thus, the stronger is placed at a lower position, while the softer is higher ranked.
