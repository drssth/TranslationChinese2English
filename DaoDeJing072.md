# 我来翻译道德经之072 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 072

民不畏威，则大威至。
The nation would be in great danger if people do not respect authorities.
无狎其所居，无厌其所生。夫唯不厌，是以不厌。
(It takes efforts for the authorities to be respected.) The authorities shall not harm people's lives or hinder their living. Only with no harm or hindrance, the people would not hate their authorities. (With no hate, they will pay enough respect to them.)
是以圣人自知不自见，自爱不自贵。故去彼取此。
This is the reason that the saints should teach themselves new knowledge but not insist on their own opinions. It is also the reason that they should have more love inside themselves but not act as they are higher above the common people. So that we should choose one and forsake the other.
