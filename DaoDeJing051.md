# 我来翻译道德经之051 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 051

道生之，德畜之，物形之，势成之。
All beings and life are created by the ultimate rule, raised by good virtue, shaped by their surrounding, and made into success by the flow.
是以万物莫不尊道而贵德。
Therefore, all beings and life should respect the ultimate rule and value good virtue.
道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之命而常自然。
The ultimate rule is noble and the virtue is precious. Because they do not take away life and always present naturally.
故道生之，德畜之，长之育之，成之熟之；养之覆之。
Therefore, the ultimate rule creates life. The virtue raises life. The beings are growing, nourished, grown, matured, cared, and protected.
生而不有，为而不恃，长而不宰，是谓玄德。
Create but not possess, act but not rely on, raise but not dominate. These actions are examples of the grand virtue.
