# 我来翻译道德经之003 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 003

## 原文

不尚贤， 使民不争。
不贵难得之货，使民不为盗。
不见可欲，使民心不乱。
是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨；
常使民无知、无欲，使夫智者不敢为也。
为无为，则无不治。

## English

The people will not fight (over fame) if we do not boast on what is good.
The people will not steal if we do not make rare things expensive.
The people will not be anxious if they do not see their needs and desires.

Therefore, the saints shall rule to let people be humbled in heart, be full in stomachs, be weak for desires, and be strong in spirits.
So that the people are kept not clever and with no desire, and even the smart will not dare to interfere.
We shall lead with no promotion, and thus the world shall be in harmony and in good order.
