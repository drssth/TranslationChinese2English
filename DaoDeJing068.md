# 我来翻译道德经之068 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 068

善为士者，不武；
Those who are good at tactics would not engage in brutal fights.
善战者，不怒；
Those who are good at fighting would not leave themselves under the control of anger.
善胜敌者，不与；
Those who always succeed would not follow conventional rules and ideas.
善用人者，为之下。
Those who are good leaders always take the lower positions.
是谓不争之德，是谓用人之力，是谓配天古之极。
All the above people achieve by implementing the grand virtue without deliberation and interfering.  They achieve by borrowing power from other people. Their actions are aligned with the ultimate rule and in harmony with the world regardless of location and time.
