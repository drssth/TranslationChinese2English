# 我来翻译道德经之073 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 073

勇于敢则杀，勇于不敢则活。
Those who are bold at taking actions will be killed.
Those who are bold at learning boundaries and limitations will survive.
此两者，或利或害。
Both of these two actions are brave, but one is beneficial while the other is harmful.
天之所恶，孰知其故？是以圣人犹难之。
(Why this is beneficial while that is harmful is decided by heaven.) Who can explain well the preference and favor of heaven?
Even the saints cannot understand the way of heaven.
天之道，不争而善胜，不应而善应，不召而自来，繟然而善谋。
The ultimate rule (the way of heaven) never competes but always wins. 
It never answers with voice but always provides feedbacks. It comes forward without being called forth. It rests in peace but is good at planning.
天网恢恢，疏而不失。
The net of heaven is vast and boundless. It is sparse, but nothing can go through it.
