# 我来翻译道德经之038 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 038

上德不德，是以有德；
The high-level virtue indicates that the good actions are taken by instinct but not intended (for praises). The actions are sincere since they are not motivated by their outcomes.
下德不失德，是以无德。
The low-level virtue indicates that the actions are intended for not receiving criticisms. These actions are not sincere since they are motivated by the outcomes.
上德无为而无以为；下德为之而有以为。
The high-level virtue is not a deliberate intention neither based on reasoning. The low-level virtue is a deliberate intention and is grounded by outcome-reasoning.
上仁为之而无以为；上义为之而有以为。
The high-level benevolence is a deliberate intention but not based on outcome-reasoning. The high-level righteousness is not only a deliberate intention but also based on outcome-reasoning.
上礼为之而莫之应，则攘臂而扔之。
The high-level courtesy and justice is not only a deliberate intention but also mandatory if not complied.
故失道而后德，失德面后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼。
Therefore, you shall follow virtue when you lost the way of heaven; you shall act upon benevolence when you lost virtue; you shall justify your actions according to righteousness when you lost benevolence; you shall comply to courtesy and justice when you lost righteousness.
夫礼者，忠信之薄，而乱之首。
Thus, courtesy and justice are not only the outcomes of lacking loyalty and trust but also the beginning of chaos and tragedies.
前识者，道之华，而愚之始。
Those who press on courtesy and justice are not touching the ultimate rule but only seeing its surface, which is a start of being shallow and stupid.
是以大丈夫处其厚，不居其薄；处其实，不居其华。
Therefore, gentlemen shall take a solid stand and not walk on thin ice. For the same reason, they shall take the core of the ultimate rule instead of only touching the surface.
故去彼取此。
As a result, we shall know how to make choices (as for which one to follow and which one to forsake).
