# 我来翻译道德经之010 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 010

## 原文

载营魄抱一，能无离乎？
专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？
涤除玄览，能无疵乎？
爱国治民，能无为乎？
天门开阖，能为雌乎？
明白四达，能无知乎。
生之畜之，生而不有，为而不恃，长而不宰，是谓玄德。

## English

The soul and flesh are united (as a person), yet cannot they also be separated?
Specify the use of (bio) energy for gentleness, can it be as gentle as a new born baby?
Clarify confusion and take a meaningful observation,  can it be un-faulted?
Love the people and govern the nation with order, can it be done without interference?
Use our senses to feel the world, can it be done with calm and stillness?
Understand and gain knowledge in diverse aspects, can it be done without wisdom?

Create it and raise it, create but not possess, 
do but not rely, raise but not dominate, 
these actions follow the rule of heaven and are considered good virtual.
