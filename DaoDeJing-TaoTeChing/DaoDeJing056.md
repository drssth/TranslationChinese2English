# 我来翻译道德经之056 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 056

知者不言，言者不知。
The wise people do not speak much. The talking people do not have much wisdom.
塞其兑，闭其门；挫其锐，解其纷；和其光，同其尘，是谓玄同。
Being synchronized with the ultimate rule blocks the leaking holes, closes the openings, blunts the sharp blades, prunes complex details, tunes with light, and mixes with dust.
故不可得而亲，不可得而疏；
不可得而利，不可得而害；
不可得而贵，不可得而贱；
故为天下贵。
Therefore, those who are synchronized with the ultimate rule exist above the close or distant relationships, achieve beyond the benefits and harms, and stand to exceed the dignity and humiliation. They are respected and honored by the rest of the world.
