# 我来翻译道德经之043 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 043

天下之至柔，驰骋天下之至坚。
The extremely soft material runs through the extremely firm matter in the world.
无有入无间，吾是以知无为之有益。
The formless pierces into the crackless (with tremendous power). Thus, I learn about the benefits of being "formless".  
不言之教，无为之益，天下希及之。
Such as teaching without words, benefits without deliberation. They are the best and with no rival.
