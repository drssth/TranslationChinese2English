# 我来翻译道德经之057 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 057

以正治国，以奇用兵，以无事取天下。
Rule the nation with justice. 
Lead the troops with unexcepted schemes.
Win the world over by not interfering.
吾何以知其然哉？
How do I know about it?
以此：
Through the following facts:
天下多忌讳，而民弥贫；
There are so many taboos in this world, while the people suffer from poverty.
人多利器，国家滋昏；
More destructive weapons people possess, more chaos the nation is.
人多伎巧，奇物滋起；
More clever techniques people devise, weirder the stuff become and arise.
法令滋彰，盗贼多有。
Stricter rules and laws are enforced, more lawless actions take place.
故圣人云："我无为，而民自化；我好静，而民自正；我无事，而民自富；我无欲，而民自朴"。
Therefore, the saints said: "the people learn about enlightenment if I do not interfere with them; The people will enjoy justice if I have peace; The people will keep wealth if I do not perform construction; The people will remain pure if I have no desire."
