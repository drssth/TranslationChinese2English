# 我来翻译道德经之050 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 050

出生入死，生之徒，十有三；死之徒，十有三；人之生，动之于死地，亦十有三。
People are born into life and leave for death.
Thirty percent of these people live their (long) lives. Another thirty percent leave this world early and embrace death by fate. The other thirty percent of people are supposed to have (long) lives but trick themselves into death.
夫何故？以其生生之厚。
Why is that, even when their lives are created to be long and beneficial? 
盖闻善摄生者，陆行不遇兕虎，入军不被甲兵。
I heard that the ones who are good at protecting their lives would not encounter dangerous animals such as rhinoceros or tiger. They even stay alive as soldiers on the battle-fields during wars.
兕无所投其角，虎无所措其爪，兵无所容其刃。
Rhinoceros cannot touch them with their horns. Tigers cannot harm them with their paws. Blades cannot pierce their body.
夫何故？以其无死地。
How is that? It is because death has not yet touched them.
