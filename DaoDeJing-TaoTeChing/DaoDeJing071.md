# 我来翻译道德经之071 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 071

知不知，尚矣；不知知，病也。
Those who know that they lack wisdom are wise people. Those who are not aware that they are short of wisdom are stupid.
圣人不病，以其病病。
The saints are not stupid because they recognize and treat their weaknesses.
夫唯病病，是以不病。
They are not stupid only because they can identify and address their shortcomings as real weaknesses.
