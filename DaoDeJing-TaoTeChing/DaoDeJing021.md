# 我来翻译道德经之021 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 021

## 原文

孔德之容，惟道是从。
道之为物，惟恍惟惚。
惚兮恍兮，其中有象；
恍兮惚兮，其中有物；
窈兮冥兮，其中有精，
其精甚真，其中有信，
自今及古，其名不去，以阅众甫。
吾何以知众甫之状哉？以此。

## English

The grand virtual depends on and follows the ultimate rule.
The ultimate rule does not have a clear image and is always confusing.
While it is confusing it still manifests phenomena.
Without a clear image, it still presents physical matters.
It is profound, and it is subtle. It is with its essence.
It is essential, and it is true. It is with its proof.
Its name stands since the early human history. It is fundamental for the observation of everything.
How do I know the situation of many things? They all start from it (the ultimate rule).
