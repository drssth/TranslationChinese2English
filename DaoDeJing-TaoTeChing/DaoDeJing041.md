# 我来翻译道德经之041 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 041

上士闻道，勤而行之；
The best wise and knowledgeable people are diligent in practicing the ultimate rule when they learn about it.
中士闻道，若存若亡；
The second place wise and knowledgeable people doubt the ultimate rule and align with it sometimes.
下士闻道，大笑之。
The least wise and knowledgeable people laugh at the ultimate rule when they hear about it.
不笑不足以为道。
It is not worthy to be a rule if not been laughed at.
故建言有之：明道若昧，进道若退，夷道若纇。
Therefore, there is a saying: the paths to clarity and benefits are not clear; the paths to progress look like leading to a backward retreat; the paths to peace appear as rough.
上德若谷；
The best virtue is like a valley (to contain other lives) (so that it has a lower position); 
大白若辱；
The pure white color looks as not pure (in our eyes). 
广德若不足；
To spread good virtue makes it not enough (as people feel it).
建德若偷；
To establish good virtue appears as being mean.
质真若渝。
The pure quality seems to have some contaminant.
大方无隅；
The grand square appears without an angle.
大器晚成；
The significant talent is cultivated for a longer period of time.
大音希声；
The magnificent music does not have many notes. 
大象无形；
The majestic phenomenon does not have a notable form. 
道隐无名 。
The ultimate rule hides its true name.
夫唯道，善贷且成。
However, only the ultimate rule is good at giving and offering so that other lives and beings may multiply, flourish, and achieve in their ways.
