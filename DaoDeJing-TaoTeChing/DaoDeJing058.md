# 我来翻译道德经之058 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 058

其政闷闷，其民淳淳；
If the policies are generous and loose, the people are happy and honest.
其政察察，其民缺缺。
If the policies are strict and tough, the people are complaining and unhappy.
祸兮，福之所倚；福兮，祸之所伏。
The blessings and happiness rely on the tragedies and miseries. 
The tragedies and miseries are the potential destinations of the blessings and happiness.
孰知其极：其无正也。
Who knows the boundary between happiness and misery? 
Who knows the distinction between blessing and tragedy?
(Who knows how to separate the two sides?)
There is no such standard.
正复为奇，善复为妖。
The positivity can turn into negativity. The blessings can transform into tragedies.
人之迷，其日固久。
The people have been confused for a long time. 
是以圣人方而不割，廉而不刿，直而不肆，光而不耀。
Therefore, the saints follow principles but do not hurt. They are honest but do not sting. They are straight but do not go beyond limits. They are like soft light which is shining but not dazzling.
