# 我来翻译道德经之078 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 078

天下莫柔弱于水，而攻坚强者莫之能胜，以其无以易之。
The softest material is water in this world. But none of the hard materials can win against it. Thus, water is not replaceable.
弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，天下莫不知，莫能行。
The weak wins against the strong. The soft wins against the hard. People in this world all know about it, but none of them can implement it.
是以圣人云："受国之垢，是谓社稷主；受国不祥，是为天下王。"
So the saints say: "The leader of a nation bears all of its humiliation. The king of this world bears all of its evil, disaster, and ominousness."
正言若反。
Often the positive words sound negative.
