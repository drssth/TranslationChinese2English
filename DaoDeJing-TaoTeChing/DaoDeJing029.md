# 我来翻译道德经之029 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 029

## 原文

将欲取天下而为之，吾见其不得已。
天下神器，不可为也，不可执也。
为者败之，执者失之。
是以圣人无为，故无败，故无失。
夫物或行或随；或觑或吹；或强或羸；或载或隳。
是以圣人去甚、去奢、去泰。

## English

Those who want to take over the world into their possession and act upon it, I do not think they will ever succeed.
The world is a holy craft. No one can ever take possession of it. No one can ever take charge of it.
The ones who try to take possession of it shall fail. The ones who try to take charge of it shall lose it.
Therefore, the saints do not interfere (the world); thus, he shall not fail either lose it.
Given the fact that people have diverse ways of doing things: some shall take the lead while some shall follow others; some shall observe while some shall preach around; some shall be the strong while some shall be the weak; some shall create while some shall destroy.
Therefore, the saints shall prevent indulgence, excessiveness, and self-pride.
