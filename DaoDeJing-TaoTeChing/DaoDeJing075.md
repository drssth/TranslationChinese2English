The people are hungry because they pay too much tax.
民之难治，以其上之有为，是以难治。
The people are difficult to govern because the rules are not easy for them to follow.
民之轻死，以其上求生之厚，是以轻死。
The people take death lightly because their higher-ranked officials pursue luxury living (instead of serving the people).
夫唯无以生为者，是贤于贵生。
Those who cannot have anything to live on will live too hard to care about living.
