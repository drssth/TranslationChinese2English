# 我来翻译道德经之011 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 011

## 原文

三十幅共一毂，当其无，有车之用。
埏埴以为器，当其无，有器之用。
凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用。
故有之以为利，无之以为用。

## English

A topical wheel has thirty spokes that are connected to the center hub, and they support the carriage with the absence of materials in the middle -- the emptiness between the spikes.

Pots and bowls are made of clay. They can be used as containers because they are empty in the middle.

People make openings on the walls to make room for windows and doors; such emptiness allowed the construction to be used as houses and rooms.

Therefore, the existence of materials are useful for their benefits, while the absence and emptiness are contributive for their usage.
