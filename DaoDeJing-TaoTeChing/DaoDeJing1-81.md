## 原文

道可道，非常道；名可名，非常名。  
无名天地之始；有名万物之母。  
故常无，欲以观其妙；常有，欲以观其徼。  
此两者同出而异名，同谓之玄。  
玄之又玄，众妙之门。  

## English

The rule that rules everything -- Dao -- can be explained, yet it is not a common rule;  
the name that represents everything can be named, yet it is not a common name.  
Before we could ever name a thing there was the beginning of this universe;  
when things could be named the mother of all existence started to nurture all her children.  
Therefore, the common non-existence or absence of things should be observed for their wonders,  
the common existence of things should be explored for their boundaries.  
The absence and existence have different names while they share the same source, they can both be called miracles.  
The recognition of the miraculous miracles is the opened door towards all wonders.

## 原文

天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。  
皆知善之为善，斯不善已。  
故有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相倾，音声相和，前後相随。  
是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教，万物作焉而不辞。  
生而不有，为而不恃，功成而弗居。  
夫唯弗居，是以不去。  

## English

All people know what beauty is and why it is beautiful because of the differentiation of what is ugly.  
All people know what good is and why it is good due to the distinguishment of what is bad.    
So that the existence is defined by absence; the easy is measured with the difficult; the short is compared by the long, the low is towered by the high, the sound is companied by the rhythm, the former is followed by the latter.  
Therefore, the saints do not act for interference (but for caring), teach not by dry speech (but by demostration), then everything shall take actions upon themselves and never reject.  
Create but not possess, do but not rely, achieve but not take.  
If only we do not take, we shall make our solid stand and never lose.

常使民无知、无欲，使夫智者不敢为也。
为无为，则无不治。

## English

The people will not fight (over fame) if we do not boast on what is good.
The people will not steal if we do not make rare things expensive.
The people will not be anxious if they do not see their needs and desires.

Therefore, the saints shall rule to let people be humbled in heart, be full in stomachs, be weak for desires, and be strong in spirits.
So that the people are kept not clever and with no desire, and even the smart will not dare to interfere.
We shall lead with no promotion, and thus the world shall be in harmony and in good order.

## English

The rule that rules all is hollowed, but we could not apply it completely.
It is profound, like the ancestor of all existence.
It blunts blades, prunes details, tunes light, and mixes itself with dust.
It hides its clear image, yet it is still there.
I do not know who could ever create it, since it looks like the ancestor of the king of heaven.

多闻数穷，不若守于中。

## English

If heaven and earth do not have mercy, then all lives on earth would be their sacrifice.
If saints do not have mercy, then all the people on earth would be their sacrifice.
Does the space between the heaven and earth not like a wind tube for a stove?
It is hollow and it does not subdue; the fire grows when you make it move.
Therefore, too much information would confuse people and people should rather keep their inner peace.

非以其无私邪！故能成其私。

## English

Both the heaven and the earth exist forever.

Because they themselves are not growing, they will not perish and are immortal.

Therefore, the saints always put themselves after other people to take a leading position, and always have no regard for themselves to gain their solid standing.

Does it not because of their unselfishness that they could make their achievements?

## English

The ultimate good (virtue) is like water.
Water benefits all lives and it does never fight over things with others; 
it flows towards lower positions and is humbled in sights of others; therefore, it is the closest to the rule of heaven.

When water dwells, its surroundings benefit from its existence.
As for its heart, it is calm and profound.
When it interacts with others, it is compassionate to do good deeds.
When it makes its sounds (and speaks), it keeps its word (and promises).
When it governs, it brings order and harmony.
When it undertakes tasks, it is capable for achievements.
When it acts, it acts at the right timing.

Because it does not fight with others, it cannot be faulted.

## 原文

三十幅共一毂，当其无，有车之用。
埏埴以为器，当其无，有器之用。
凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用。
故有之以为利，无之以为用。

## English

A topical wheel has thirty spokes that are connected to the center hub, and they support the carriage with the absence of materials in the middle -- the emptiness between the spikes.

Pots and bowls are made of clay. They can be used as containers because they are empty in the middle.

People make openings on the walls to make room for windows and doors; such emptiness allowed the construction to be used as houses and rooms.

Therefore, the existence of materials are useful for their benefits, while the absence and emptiness are contributive for their usage.

## English

Too many colors would make our sights blind;
Too many sounds would make our hearing deaf;
Too many flavors would make our tastes numb;
Release too much of our desires would drive us crazy.
The rare goods are tempting people to do bad deeds.
Therefore, the saints desire a full stomach but not luxury entertainments; 
thus they have principles for doing and not doing.

## 原文

宠辱若惊，贵大患若身。
何谓宠辱若惊？
宠为下，得之若惊，失之若惊，是谓宠辱若惊。
何谓贵大患若身？
吾所以有大患者，为吾有身，及吾无身，吾有何患。
故贵以身为天下，若可寄天下。
爱以身为天下，若可托天下。

## English

People should be sensitive and mindful on received praises and criticizes, and value setbacks the same as their lives.

How to be sensitive and mindful on praises and criticizes?
Praises are the low-end benefits. 
We are sensitive and mindful on them when we receive them, while at the same time we are sensitive and mindful when we do not receive them. Both together is to be sensitive and mindful on praises and criticizes.

Why to value setbacks the same as our lives?
The reason that we have setbacks is because we are flesh and we live our lives. 
If we are not flesh and do not live our lives, how could we have setbacks in our lives?

To extend this idea, we should value and respect this world the same as we value and respect ourselves (because our existence originated from this world and now depend on this world) and we should take care of this world. We should love this world the same as we love ourselves and we should take responsibilities of this world.

## 原文

视而不见，名曰夷；
听之不闻，名曰希；
搏之不得，名曰微。
此三者不可致诘，故混而为一。
其上不徼，其下不昧，
绳绳兮不可名，复归于无物。
是谓无状之状，无物之象，是谓惚恍。
迎之不见其首，随之不见其后。
执古之道，以御今之有。
能知古始，是谓道纪。

## English

A thing that cannot be seen, it is called Yi - with no color;
A rhythm that cannot be heard, it is called Xi - with no sound;
An object that cannot be touched, it is called Wei - with no form.
These three kinds of substance are often considered as one because they cannot be carefully observed with triditional means.
From one aspect, they are lacking clarity; however, from another, their existence is not a confusion.
Even when you try to observe them with caution you still fail to name their attributes; thus, they just merge into nothing in your eyes.
Therefore, they are called a form without shape, a phenomenon without body, and the blurry chaos.
You cannot see them when they are before you; you cannot trace them when you try to follow them.
However, you can command the currently available situations by following the ancient fundamental principles — the rule of all, or the ultimate rule.  
When you understand how everything come to be in the very beginning, it means you understand the rule of all.

孰能浊以静之徐清？孰能安以动之徐生？
保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽而新成。

## English

In the old times, the ones who aligned with the ultimate rule were profound in many ways and difficult to understand.
Because they were difficult to understand for their motivation and deep thinking, people could only describe their appearance and deeds.
They were careful like walking on the iced river in the winter.
They were always cautioned like they respected and feared all neighbors.
They were respectful like they were guests in others homes.
They were cool, free, and easy just like water flows from melted ice.
They were simple, honest, and true just like raw materials not crafted.
They were insightful and open-minded like a deep valley that you never know their limits.
They were bold and vigorous that you could never predict their actions.
They were boundless and profound like the ocean.
They sound like wind blows and never stop.

Who else could calm chaos and have clarity and peace?
Who else could maintain peace to bring vitality and nurture new lives?
Those who stick to the ultimate rule will not take pride in their achievements.
Because they never take pride, they could always let go their past, take new challenges, and regain new accomplishments.

When I banish all noises in mind and heart, I am able to keep the tranquility and peacefullness in life and soul.
Then, everything starts to grow vigorously and I am able to observe their changing trajectory and trends.
All beings grow and multiply, and aligned with the ultimate rule.
Been aligned with the ultimate rule indicates peace. Peace means re-creation of life.
Re-creation of life is the way of nature. Understanding the way of nature is wisdom.
(However,) Ignorance of the way of nature implies omen or disaster.
(On the contrary,) Understanding of the way of nature brings harmony and order. 
Harmony and order bring justice. 
Justice brings completeness and fairness in every aspect. 
Completeness and fairness in every aspect is descended from heaven. 
Descended from heaven is the ultimate rule; thus, it lasts forever and will not perish.

People will regain love and kindness when the we stop praising for compassion and justice.

There is one thing that formed from chaos before the heaven and the earth.
It is silent, independent of other forces and never changes. 
It cycles in periods and never ends. 
It is the mother of heaven and earth.
I do not know its name. I shall name it as "dao" -- the trajectory of all, the ultimate rule, the way of heaven. I shall give it a surname as "grand".
The surname "grand" indicates it functions and never ends. It never ends functioning so that it reaches far beyond (the world we are limited in). The far distance (in time and space) it reaches makes it returns to and governs the origin of this world.
Therefore, the "dao" is "grand"; and so is the heaven; so is the earth, so are the human beings.
We say that there are four "grand beings" in this world and one of them is human.
The human learns, follows, and absorbs the rules according to the earth.

The world is a holy craft. No one can ever take possession of it. No one can ever take charge of it.
The ones who try to take possession of it shall fail. The ones who try to take charge of it shall lose it.
Therefore, the saints do not interfere (the world); thus, he shall not fail either lose it.
Given the fact that people have diverse ways of doing things: some shall take the lead while some shall follow others; some shall observe while some shall preach around; some shall be the strong while some shall be the weak; some shall create while some shall destroy.
Therefore, the saints shall prevent indulgence, excessiveness, and self-pride.

夫兵者，不祥之器，物或恶之，故有道者不处。
Weapons are ominous and not tools for peace. People dislike them, and the saints aligned with the ultimate rule do not engage with them.
君子居则贵左，用兵则贵右。
Saints who take responsibility for peace shall value the left-wing principles while those who take charge of wars shall value the right-wing principles.
兵者不祥之器，非君子之器，不得已而用之，恬淡为上，胜而不美，而美之者，是乐杀人。
Weapons are not tools for peace nor used by gentlemen. The saints use them out of necessity with an objective attitude instead of subjective enjoyment. They do not take pride or positive emotions over the use of weapons. Those take a positive attitude are enjoying killing. 
夫乐杀人者，则不可得志于天下矣。
Those who take pleasure in killing will never have the way of the world.
吉事尚左，凶事尚右。
We put the positive things on the left to indicate that we should handle them with left-wing-policies. On the contrary, we put the ominous things on the right side to indicate that we should handle them with right-wing-policies.

故失道而后德，失德面后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼。

是以候王自称孤、寡、不谷。此非以贱为本邪？非乎？
This is the reason that the lords and kings refer themselves as 'a single person', 'a person lost the other half', or 'the one with no child'. Aren't their actions demonstrations of humiliation? Aren't they?

道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。
The ultimate rule generates the one; the one splits into the two sides (the binary representative yin and yang); the two sides produce into the three stages (the beginning, the flipping/tipping point, and the ending). The three stages multiply into every existence.
万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和。
All beings turn their backs towards (but rely on) yin (the hidden, the storage, the inside, the negative, etc.) while facing (embracing) yang (the apparent, the consuming, the outside, the positive, etc.). 
They unit the opposite sides into their harmony.
人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以为称。
Such as people despise the 'single person', 'person lost the other half', and 'the one with no child'; yet the lords and kings refer themselves as such.
故物或损之而益，或益之而损。
Therefore, things will be improved if they are damaged; they will also be damaged if they are well-developed.
人之所教，我亦教之。
I shall teach others the same way I was taught.

治大国，若烹小鲜，以道莅天下，其鬼不神。
Governing a large nation is like frying a small fish (you cannot flip the little fish too many times or else it smashes its tenderness).
