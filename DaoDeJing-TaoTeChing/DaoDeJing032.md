# 我来翻译道德经之032 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 032

道常无名，朴。
The ultimate rule does not hold its fame but rather stick to its nature.
虽小，天下莫能臣。
It is modest, yet it obeys no one.
候王若能守之，万物将自宾。
If the lords and kings could keep it, people shall follow them from their hearts.
天地相合，以降甘露，民莫之令而自均。
If the earth aligns with the heaven, generous rains will nourish the lands and people will act upon themselves for equality and justice.
始制有名，名亦既有，夫亦将知止，知止可以不殆。
To start constructing regulations and institutions we need to name a cause. With a named cause people will be aware of the inhibition. The recognition of the inhibition will keep people from danger.
譬道之在天下，犹川谷之于江海。
We say that the meaning of the ultimate rule to the world is like rivers and lakes to the ocean.
