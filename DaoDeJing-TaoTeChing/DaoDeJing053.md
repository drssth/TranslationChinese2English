# 我来翻译道德经之053 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 053

使我介然有知，行于大道，唯施是畏。
If I have a little bit wisdom, I would know that the only thing to be feared is to take shortcuts when walking on a wide road.
大道甚夷，而人好径。
The grand road (the ultimate rule is like a way or a road) is wide and smooth. But people like shortcuts.
朝甚除，田甚芜，仓甚虚，服文采，带利剑，厌饮食，财货有余，是谓盗竽。非道也哉！
The rulers wear expensive clothing and fancy swords, overeat, and possess wealth while the government is not in order, the farm fields do not grow crops, and the warehouses are empty. These actions are the same as stealing and not aligned to the ultimate rule.
