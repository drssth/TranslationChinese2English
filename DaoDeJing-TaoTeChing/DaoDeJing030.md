# 我来翻译道德经之030 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 030

以道佐人主者，不以兵强天下，其事好还。
The advisors who use the ultimate rule to assist a ruler do not conquer the world by force because they know that such an action shall be followed with a pay-back consequence.
师之所处，荆棘生焉。
Thorns shall grow whenever the army leave the places they battled in.
大军之后，必有凶年。
Famine shall terror the land whenever the troops leave the people behind.
善有果而已，不敢以取强。
The ones who are good at warfare would rather have their beneficial outcomes rather than take possession of the lands with forces.
果而勿矜，果而勿伐，果而勿骄，果而不得已，果而勿强。
To keep the fruit of their beneficial warfare, they will not be shy or reserved; they will not brag about their actions; they will not take pride in conquering; they will not force their ways if they fail.
物壮则老，是谓不道，不道早已。
Things become frail from their strong and powerful statuses because they have lost the standards of the ultimate rule for a long period of time.
