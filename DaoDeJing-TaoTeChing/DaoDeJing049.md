# 我来翻译道德经之049 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 049

圣人常无心，以百姓之心为心。
The saints do not have selfish hearts (they do not have their own hearts). They have hearts that represent the people (They adopt the hearts of the people).
善者，吾善之；不善者，吾亦善之，德善。
I treat the kind-hearted people with kindness. I also treat the inhumane with kindness. Thus, I achieve true kindness.
信者，吾信之；不信者，吾亦信之，德信。
I trust those who are trustworthy. I also trust those who are not trustworthy. Thus, I accomplish real trust.
圣人在天下，歙歙焉为天下浑其心，百姓皆注其耳目，圣人皆孩之。
The saints live in this world. They purify their hearts for the benefits of the world and the people in each breath. Their people watch them, hear from them, and pay attention to them. The saints treat their people as if they were their children.
