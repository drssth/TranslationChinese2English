# 我来翻译道德经之063 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 063

为无为，事无事，味无味。
We act without deliberate intention, serve when there is no certain requirement, and have a taste of the unspiced nature.
大小多少，报怨以德。
We enlarge the small, multiply the unpopulated, and react to resentment with love and care.
图难于其易，为大于其细。
We tackle the difficulties by starting from their easy parts.
We implement big plans by performing their subtle details.
天下难事，必作于易；天下大事，必作于细。
This is because all difficulties can only be conquered from their soft parts; all grand events are stimulated from insignificant details.
是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大。
Thus, the saints make accomplishments and become well-known by never intended for personal gain and fame.
夫轻诺必寡信，多易必多难。
Those who take promises lightly will not be trusted; those who do things easily will experience more hardships.
是以圣人犹难之，故终无难矣。
This is the reason that the saints always consider things are difficult when they start to do it so that they never experience real difficulties.
