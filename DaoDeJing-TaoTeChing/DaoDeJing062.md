# 我来翻译道德经之062 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 062

道者，万物之奥，善人之宝，不善人之所保。
The ultimate rule is the secret of all wonders.
The good people treasure it.
The bad ones try to keep it.
美言可以市尊，美行可以加人。
The good words declare and demonstrate respect.
The good actions praise and benefit their takers.
人之不善，何弃之有？
Thus, how could the bad people discard the ultimate rule (the good words and actions) (given the outcome gains)?
故立天子，置三公，虽有拱璧以先驷马，不如坐进此道。
Therefore, it would be better to let the king align his seat with the ultimate rule than the ritual of riding horses and showing off precious artifacts when he ascends to the throne and nominates the lords.
古之所以贵此道者何？
Why do the people treasure the ultimate rule since the ancient times?
不曰：求以得，有罪以免邪？
Did they not say this "I want to hold on to it (the ultimate rule) so that I can avoid harms even when I am sinful"?
故为天下贵。
This is the reason the whole world treasures it.
