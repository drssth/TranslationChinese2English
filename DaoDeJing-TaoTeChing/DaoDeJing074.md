# 我来翻译道德经之074 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 074

民不畏死，奈何以死惧之。
There is no use to threaten people's lives when they do not fear death.
若使民常畏死，而为奇者，吾得执而杀之，孰敢？
If people always fear death, then who dare to do evil if we set laws to kill them? 
常有司杀者杀。
Some people do evil while they are law-keepers. (They are not persecuted according to the law.)
夫代司杀者杀，是谓代大匠斫，希有不伤其手者矣。
I see those who do evil while they are law-keepers as those who pretend to be master carpenters, and they are easy to have their fingers injured by the carpenter-knife.
