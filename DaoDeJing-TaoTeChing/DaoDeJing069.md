# 我来翻译道德经之069 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 069

用兵有言："吾不敢为主，而为客；不敢进寸，而退尺。"
There is a saying for warfare: "I would rather keep a protective and defensive position in wars than to take an aggressive and conquering positive over other nations. I would rather protectively retreat for a foot but not aggressively for an inch."
是谓行无行；攘无臂；扔无敌；执无兵。
This helps us to undertake the unachievable accomplishments, to lift up things even when losing physical arms, to stand with no rival, and to fight a war without an army.
祸莫大于轻敌，轻敌几丧吾宝。
The greatest disaster is to underestimate our enemy, which often let us lose our own benefits and privileges.
故抗兵相若，哀者胜矣。
Therefore, the humbled troops often win when they fight with their equivalent opponents.
