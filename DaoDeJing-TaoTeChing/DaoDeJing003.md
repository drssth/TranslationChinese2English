# 我来翻译道德经之003 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 003


不尚贤， 使民不争。

The people will not fight (over fame) if we do not boast on what is good.

不贵难得之货，使民不为盗。

The people will not steal if we do not make rare things expensive.

不见可欲，使民心不乱。

The people will not be anxious if they are not troubled by their needs and desires.

是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨；

Therefore, the saints shall rule to let people be humbled in hearts, be full in stomachs, be weak for desires (the original word means will), and be strong in spirits (the original word means bones).

常使民无知、无欲，使夫智者不敢为也。

So that the people are kept not clever and without desire, then, even the wise will not dare to interfere.

为无为，则无不治。

We shall lead with no promotion, and then, the world shall be in harmony and in good order.
