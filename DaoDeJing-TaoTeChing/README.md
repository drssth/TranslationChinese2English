# Let-me-translate-Dao-De-Jing-to-English

## significance

 Taoism (Daoism), Confucianism, and Buddism are considered as "three pillars of traditional Chinese culture". Daoism explains “nature” and the “Natural Ultimate” which is referred to with a general term which means "sky or heaven" (天). Daoism, in the depth of Chinese culture, means "the attributes and the identity of the Natural Ultimate", if paraphrased in English. For a direct translation, it means "The Way" -- "The Way of All." Daoism describes the "principles of the world". In comparison, Confucianism deals with "principles of the society and human interactions"; Buddism brings clarity about "my identity and myself". 

Daoism was first presented in the book "Dao De Jing" -- "the classical interpretation of the Natural Ultimate". The author of this book is Dan Li (571 B.C. - 471 B.C. approximately), who was said had lived 101 years.

Daoism is called "Daoism" because its subject is called "Dao" in Chinese. It means "The Way" in Chinese literally. But it has profound meanings. I want to describe it as the "Natural Ultimate" if mapped into western culture. But it is not about the one and only god. It is about the principles of this world and humanity. So I would like to use the terms "the rule that rules everything" and "the rule of all" to replace "Dao" in my translation.

As a summary, this book is about reasons and facts. I want readers to find this book rational and reasonable.

## motivation

I translate this version in the hope that it functions better in bridging cultures.
