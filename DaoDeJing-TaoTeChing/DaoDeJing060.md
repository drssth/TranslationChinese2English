# 我来翻译道德经之060 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 060

治大国，若烹小鲜，以道莅天下，其鬼不神。
Governing a large nation is like frying a small fish (you cannot flip the little fish too many times or else it smashes its tenderness). 
None evil will take effect if we govern the world with the ultimate rule.
非其鬼不神，其神不伤人。
It is not that the evils do not exist, but they cannot harm people.
非其神不伤人，圣人亦不伤人。
Neither the evils nor the saints will harm the people.
夫两不相伤，故德交归焉。
Thus, the good virtue benefits the people since neither of the opposite sides harms them.
