# 我来翻译道德经之004 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 004

## 原文

道冲，而用之或不盈。
渊兮似万物之宗。
挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。
湛兮似或存。
吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。

## English

The rule that rules all is hollowed, but we could not apply it completely.
It is profound, like the ancestor of all existence.
It blunts blades, prunes details, tunes light, and mixes itself with dust.
It hides its clear image, yet it is still there.
I do not know who could ever create it, since it looks like the ancestor of the king of heaven.
