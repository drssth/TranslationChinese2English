# 我来翻译道德经之039 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 039

昔之得一者，
There are records of those who follow the ultimate rule.
天得一以清；
The sky follows it and turns clear.
地得一以宁；
The earth follows it and has peace.
神得一以灵；
The gods follow it and exemplify holy spirits.
谷得一以盈；
The rivers and lakes follow it and overflow.
万物得一以生；
The beings follow it and sustain their lives.
候王得一以为天一正。
The lords and kings follow it and become noble.
其致之也，
The opposite of these situations is obvious.
谓天无以清，将恐裂；
The sky may fall apart if it is not clear.
地无以宁，将恐废；
The earth may enter desolation without peace.
神无以灵，将恐歇；
The gods may cease to exist if they lost holy spirits.
谷无以盈，将恐竭；
The rivers and lakes may dry out if they lose their water sources.
万物无以生，将恐灭；
The beings may die if they lose what they live on.
候王无以正，将恐蹶。
The lords and kings may lose their positions and nobility if they lose the people they are ruling.
故贵以贱为本，高以下为基。
Therefore, the nobility is founded on the ordinary and insignificance. The tall structures are established on the lower ground.
是以候王自称孤、寡、不谷。此非以贱为本邪？非乎？
This is the reason that the lords and kings refer themselves as 'a single person', 'a person lost the other half', or 'the one with no child'. Aren't their actions demonstrations of humiliation? Aren't they?
故至誉无誉。
For the same reason, too much praise and fame indicate no reputation at all.
是故不欲琭琭如玉，珞珞如石。
For the same reason, I would rather be a solid hard stone instead of a piece of beautiful precious jade.
