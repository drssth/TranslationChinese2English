# 我来翻译道德经之028 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 028

## 原文

知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪。
为天下溪，常德不离，复归于婴儿。
知其白，守其黑，为天下式，
为天下式，常德不忒，复归于无极。
知其荣，守其辱，为天下谷。
为天下谷，常德乃足，复归于朴。
朴散则为器，圣人用之，则为官长，故大制不割。

## English

Understand what is the outcome to be dominating and strong; yet still keeps a subordinating and soft position, choose to be the river that nourishes other lives.
Be the river that nourishes other lives; the long-lasting good virtue shall not lose and return to the purest state as a newborn baby.
Understand what is the outcome to be the light (and the pride); yet still keeps a dark and low profile, choose to be an example to the world.
Be an example to the world, the long-lasting good virtue shall not be faulted, and return to the fair and just state that keeps the truth.
Understand what is the outcome to be glory, yet still be humbled, choose to be a valley in the world that is at the lowest position.
Be a valley in the world that is at the lowest position; the long-lasting good virtue shall be filled full, and return to the pure and simple state that close to the origination.
The original and straightforward state of things with the truth is easy to be shaped into other useful things. Those who aligned with the ultimate rule shall use them and then they shall be good leaders. Thus, the world shall be in good order and never separate.
