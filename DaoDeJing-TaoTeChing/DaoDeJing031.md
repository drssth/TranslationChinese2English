# 我来翻译道德经之031 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 031

夫兵者，不祥之器，物或恶之，故有道者不处。
Weapons are ominous and not tools for peace. People dislike them, and the saints aligned with the ultimate rule do not engage with them.
君子居则贵左，用兵则贵右。
Saints who take responsibility for peace shall value the left-wing principles while those who take charge of wars shall value the right-wing principles.
兵者不祥之器，非君子之器，不得已而用之，恬淡为上，胜而不美，而美之者，是乐杀人。
Weapons are not tools for peace nor used by gentlemen. The saints use them out of necessity with an objective attitude instead of subjective enjoyment. They do not take pride or positive emotions over the use of weapons. Those take a positive attitude are enjoying killing. 
夫乐杀人者，则不可得志于天下矣。
Those who take pleasure in killing will never have the way of the world.
吉事尚左，凶事尚右。
We put the positive things on the left to indicate that we should handle them with left-wing-policies. On the contrary, we put the ominous things on the right side to indicate that we should handle them with right-wing-policies.
偏将军居左，上将军居右。
Thus we position the vice general on the left while the general on the right.
言以丧礼处之。
It also means we should handle wars with the code of funerals.
杀人之众，以悲哀莅之，战胜以丧礼处之。
Regardless of the outcome, wars are about massive killing. We shall engage wars with grief and treat all the dead with the code of funerals.
