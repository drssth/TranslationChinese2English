# 我来翻译道德经之061 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 061

大邦者下流，天下之牝，天下之交也。
Those great nations are like the lower courses of a river, as they sustain and nourish life as a mother, and absorb other river branches.
牝常以静胜牡，以静为下。
Their feminine characteristic as a mother beats male attributes with a humble and peaceful appearance.
故大邦以下小邦，则取小邦；
Thus, the large nations win over small nations by their humble sustainment. 
小邦以下大邦，则取大邦。
The small nations also win over the large nations by their humble services.
故或下以取，或下而取。
Therefore, they humbly lower themselves to win over each other, and they do prevail.
大邦不过欲兼畜人，小邦不过欲入事人。
The objective of large nations should be to keep the elites while they develop themselves. The aim of small nations should be to engage in the beneficial activities carried out by the elites.
夫两者各得所欲，大者宜为下。
Thus, both the large and small nations gain, while the large nations are at a lower position as the ending courses of a river to reach the ocean.
