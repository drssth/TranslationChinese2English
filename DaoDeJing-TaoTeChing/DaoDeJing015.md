# 我来翻译道德经之015 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 015

## 原文

古之善为道者，微妙玄通，深不可识。
夫唯不可识，故强为之容。
豫兮若冬涉川；犹兮若畏四邻；俨兮其若容；涣兮若冰之将释；敦兮其若朴；旷兮其若谷；混兮其若浊；澹兮其若海；飉兮若无止。
孰能浊以静之徐清？孰能安以动之徐生？
保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽而新成。

## English

In the old times, the ones who aligned with the ultimate rule were profound in many ways and difficult to understand.
Because they were difficult to understand for their motivation and deep thinking, people could only describe their appearance and deeds.
They were careful like walking on the iced river in the winter.
They were always cautioned like they respected and feared all neighbors.
They were respectful like they were guests in others homes.
They were cool, free, and easy just like water flows from melted ice.
They were simple, honest, and true just like raw materials not crafted.
They were insightful and open-minded like a deep valley that you never know their limits.
They were bold and vigorous that you could never predict their actions.
They were boundless and profound like the ocean.
They sound like wind blows and never stop.

Who else could calm chaos and have clarity and peace?
Who else could maintain peace to bring vitality and nurture new lives?
Those who stick to the ultimate rule will not take pride in their achievements.
Because they never take pride, they could always let go their past, take new challenges, and regain new accomplishments.
