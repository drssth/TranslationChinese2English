# 我来翻译道德经之024 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 024

## 原文

企者不立；跨者不行。
自见者不明；自是者不彰。
自伐者无功；自矜者不长。
其在道也曰：馀食赘形。
物或恶之，故有道者不处。

## English

Those who stand on their toes cannot hold long.
Those who step long strides cannot walk long.
Those who look at themselves cannot see the surroundings.
Those who stick to their ego cannot understand others.
Those who boast on themselves cannot make achievements.
Those who restrain themselves cannot grow in spirit.
These phenomena indicate a saying according to the ultimate rule: "eating too much introduces sickness in the form of 'obesity'"; and they are despised and shall not be practiced for those who follow the ultimate rule.
