# 我来翻译道德经之026 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 026

## 原文

重为轻根，静为躁君。
是以君子终日行不离辎重。
虽有荣观，燕处超然。
奈何万乘之主而以身轻天下？
轻则失根，躁则失君。

## English

The heavy-weighted is the root for the light-weighted.
The inner-calm governs the apparent anxiety and unrestfulness.
Therefore, the gentlemen who walk all-day-long with their armor, weapon, and supplies (such as suitable appearance and inner-calm in the heart).
Although they are surrounded by many kinds of temptation, they are still at ease and not urged.
So what good can it bring for governors of a million population to weigh themselves over their people?
They will lose their root (in people) if they weigh their people less.
They will lose their way of being gentlemen if they bring unrestfulness.
