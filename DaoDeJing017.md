# 我来翻译道德经之017 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 017

## 原文

太上，不知有之。
其次，亲而誉之。
其次，畏之。
其次，侮之。
信不足焉，有不信焉。
悠兮，其贵言。
功成事遂，百姓皆谓∶我自然。

## English

The best leaders are those who leads without people's awareness.
Worse than the best as the second place are those who are praised and loved by people.
Third place are those who are feared by people.
Fourth place are those who are criticized by people.
The leaders with less credit cannot gain trust from the people. 
Therefore, the best leaders (always) value and keep their words.
When the best leaders make achievements (in leading) and do good deeds, people all say "it is supposed to be like this".
