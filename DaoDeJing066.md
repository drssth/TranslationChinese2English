# 我来翻译道德经之066 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 066

江海之所以能为百谷王者，以其善下之，故能为百谷王。
The oceans are kings upon the rivers and lakes (as bodies of water) because they are in a lower position. (Rivers run into the oceans and merge with them.)
是以圣人欲上民，必以言下之；
Thus, the saints will use humble words before the people when they intend to dominate them.
欲先民，必以身后之。
It is because the leaders follow the people before the people follow them.
是以圣人处上而民不重，处前而民不害。
In this way, the saints dominate the people while they are not under pressure. The saints lead before the people while they are not hindered.
是以天下乐推而不厌。
So that the saints are praised and respected but not blamed or hated.
以其不争，故天下莫能与之争。
No other person can compete with the saints because they do not compete with others.
