# 我来翻译道德经之001 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 001

## 原文

道可道，非常道；名可名，非常名。  
无名天地之始；有名万物之母。  
故常无，欲以观其妙；常有，欲以观其徼。  
此两者同出而异名，同谓之玄。  
玄之又玄，众妙之门。  

## English

The rule that rules everything -- Dao -- can be explained, yet it is not a common rule;  
the name that represents everything can be named, yet it is not a common name.  
Before we could ever name a thing there was the beginning of this universe;  
when things could be named the mother of all existence started to nurture all her children.  
Therefore, the common non-existence or absence of things should be observed for their wonders,  
the common existence of things should be explored for their boundaries.  
The absence and existence have different names while they share the same source, they can both be called miracles.  
The recognition of the miraculous miracles is the opened door towards all wonders.
