# 我来翻译道德经之008 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 008

## 原文

上善若水。
水善利万物而不争，处众人之所恶，故几于道。
居，善地；
心，善渊；
与，善仁；
言，善信；
政，善治；
事，善能；
动，善时。
夫唯不争，故无尤。

## English

The ultimate good (virtue) is like water.
Water benefits all lives and it does never fight over things with others; 
it flows towards lower positions and is humbled in sights of others; therefore, it is the closest to the rule of heaven.

When water dwells, its surroundings benefit from its existence.
As for its heart, it is calm and profound.
When it interacts with others, it is compassionate to do good deeds.
When it makes its sounds (and speaks), it keeps its word (and promises).
When it governs, it brings order and harmony.
When it undertakes tasks, it is capable for achievements.
When it acts, it acts at the right timing.

Because it does not fight with others, it cannot be faulted.
