# 我来翻译道德经之052 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 052

天下有始，以为天下母。
The world has its origin. Its origin nourishes all existence and is like the mother to all.
既得其母，以知其子；
If you have the knowledge of the mother to all, you will learn about all its children -- everything in this world.
既知其子，复守其母，没身不殆。
When you gain the understanding of all existence in this world, you will comprehend their origin, and will not be in danger or trouble.
塞其兑，闭其门，终身不勤。
Blocking the breathing holes and closing the doors (toward others), there is nothing worth trying throughout your life. 
开其兑，济其事，终身不救。
Dredging the breathing holes and bringing in the benefits (to others), there is nothing need to be saved whenever you live.
见小曰明，守柔曰强。
Wisdom is the capacity to see the subtle details.
Strength is the ability to protect the gentleness.
用其光，复归其明，无遗身殃；是为袭常。
(We need to ) use the light of this world to restore its brightness. Acting towards it will never bring harm to ourselves. It is also an action against the common ways.
