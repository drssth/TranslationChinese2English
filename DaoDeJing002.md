# 我来翻译道德经之002 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 002

## 原文

天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。  
皆知善之为善，斯不善已。  
故有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相倾，音声相和，前後相随。  
是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教，万物作焉而不辞。  
生而不有，为而不恃，功成而弗居。  
夫唯弗居，是以不去。  

## English

All people know what beauty is and why it is beautiful because of the differentiation of what is ugly.  
All people know what good is and why it is good due to the distinguishment of what is bad.    
So that the existence is defined by absence; the easy is measured with the difficult; the short is compared by the long, the low is towered by the high, the sound is companied by the rhythm, the former is followed by the latter.  
Therefore, the saints do not act for interference (but for caring), teach not by dry speech (but by demostration), then everything shall take actions upon themselves and never reject.  
Create but not possess, do but not rely, achieve but not take.  
If only we do not take, we shall make our solid stand and never lose.
