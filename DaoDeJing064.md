# 我来翻译道德经之064 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 064

其安易持，其未兆易谋；
It is easy to maintain the peaceful statuses.
It is easy to tackle the obstacles when there are signs for their occurrences.
其脆易泮，其微易散。
The fragile things can be easily destroyed.
The subtle details can be easily wiped out.
为之于未有，治之于未乱。
We need to deal with situations before they take places.
We need to treat obstacles and risks before they emerge or happen.
合抱之木，生于毫末；
The giant trees grow from tiny sprouts.
九层之台，起于累土；
The skyscrapers are built by structuring materials.
千里之行，始于足下。
The global trips start from one spot on earth.
为者败之，执者失之。
We do things under the risk of failures.
We hold on to things under the risk of losing them.
是以圣人无为故无败，无执故无失。
Therefore, the saints do not act with deliberate intentions so that they shall never fail. They do not keep possessions so that they shall never lose.
民之从事，常于几成而败之。
We, as the normal people, always fail when we half through.
慎终如始，则无败事。
However, we shall not fail if we continue to be as careful as the very beginning.
是以圣人欲不欲，不贵难得之货，学不学，复众人之所过，以辅万物之自然而不敢为。
Therefore, the saints pursue the things others forsake, do not value the rare things, learn about the knowledge the others do not care about, and right others' wrongs and faults. With such actions, they are able to serve the nature of others and do not interfere.
