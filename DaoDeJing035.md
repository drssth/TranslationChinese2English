# 我来翻译道德经之035 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 035

执大象，天下往。
Those who apply the ultimate rule will attract people to go under their shields.
往而不害，安平太。
The people under their shields will not be harmed nor harm each other. Therefore, they shall have lasting safety and peace.
乐与饵，过客止。
Their joyfulness attracts others like a bait; even the passengers stop for it.
道之出口，淡乎其无味，视之不足见，听之不足闻，用之不足既。
When the ultimate rule is being preached with words, it is too plain to be tasted; it is too subtle to be seen; it is too low to be heard. However, it is too vast and grand to be applied completely.
