# 我来翻译道德经之019 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 019

## 原文

绝圣弃智，民利百倍；
绝仁弃义，民复孝慈；
绝巧弃利，盗贼无有；
此三者，以为文不足，故令有所属，
见素抱朴，少私寡欲；绝学无忧。

## English

People will benefit a hundred times if the we stop praising about wisdom and nobility.
People will regain love and kindness when the we stop praising for compassion and justice.
People will not steal when the we stop praising good artifacts and values things.
Wisdom, justice, and values are three pillars when people are lacking conscience and humanity.
They fill people's hearts with a sense of goodness and belonging.
(However, they are not enough to bring the world under good order.)
Only when we return to our original state, regain our conscience, forsake selfishness and desires, and not moved by these "good" teachings, we shall take a solid standing and never fail.
