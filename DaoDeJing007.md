# 我来翻译道德经之007 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 007

## 原文

天长，地久。
天地所以能长且久者，以其不自生，故能长生。
是以圣人後其身而身先，外其身而身存。
非以其无私邪！故能成其私。

## English

Both the heaven and the earth exist forever.

Because they themselves are not growing, they will not perish and are immortal.

Therefore, the saints always put themselves after other people to take a leading position, and always have no regard for themselves to gain their solid standing.

Does it not because of their unselfishness that they could make their achievements?
