# 我来翻译道德经之014 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 014

## 原文

视而不见，名曰夷；
听之不闻，名曰希；
搏之不得，名曰微。
此三者不可致诘，故混而为一。
其上不徼，其下不昧，
绳绳兮不可名，复归于无物。
是谓无状之状，无物之象，是谓惚恍。
迎之不见其首，随之不见其后。
执古之道，以御今之有。
能知古始，是谓道纪。

## English

A thing that cannot be seen, it is called Yi - with no color;
A rhythm that cannot be heard, it is called Xi - with no sound;
An object that cannot be touched, it is called Wei - with no form.
These three kinds of substance are often considered as one because they cannot be carefully observed with triditional means.
From one aspect, they are lacking clarity; however, from another, their existence is not a confusion.
Even when you try to observe them with caution you still fail to name their attributes; thus, they just merge into nothing in your eyes.
Therefore, they are called a form without shape, a phenomenon without body, and the blurry chaos.
You cannot see them when they are before you; you cannot trace them when you try to follow them.
However, you can command the currently available situations by following the ancient fundamental principles — the rule of all, or the ultimate rule.  
When you understand how everything come to be in the very beginning, it means you understand the rule of all.
