# 我来翻译道德经之037 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 037

道常无为而无不为。
The ultimate rule does not interfere while it is involved in all sort of things.
候王若能守之，万物将自化。
The lords and kings can turn many things into their way if they could keep applying the ultimate rule on their deeds.
化而欲作，吾将镇之以无名之朴，镇之以无名之朴，夫将不欲。
When the people turn to their own ways (benefits), I shall guide them with the purity of the ultimate rule. Thus, they will forsake their selfish desires.
不欲以静，天下将自定。
When people abandon their selfish desires, the world shall be governed by peace and justice automatically.
