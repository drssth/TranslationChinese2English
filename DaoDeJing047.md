# 我来翻译道德经之047 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 047

不出户，知天下；
They know the world even without seeing while staying at home.
不窥牖，见天道。
They witness the ultimate rule without observing from the windows. 
其出弥远，其知弥少。
The further people travel beyond distance, the lesser they will notice and understand.
是以圣人不行而知，不见而明，不为而成。
Therefore, the saints become knowledgeable not through traveling. They become wise not through witnessing. They achieve not through deliberation.
