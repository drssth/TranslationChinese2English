# 我来翻译道德经之046 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 046

天下有道，却走马以粪，天下无道，戎马生于郊。
If the nation is governed by the ultimate rule, the war-horses could only be used to farm the land. 
If the nation is not governed by the ultimate rule, the war-horses are born close to the battlefield.
祸莫大于不知足；咎莫大于欲得。
There is no greater disaster than never having satisfaction. 
There is no worse fault than greedy desires.
故知足之足，常足矣。
Therefore, those who identify the situations for contentment shall gain long-lasting happiness.
