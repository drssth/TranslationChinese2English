# 我来翻译道德经之034 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 034

大道泛兮，其可左右。 
The ultimate rule is widely applicable. It applies on opposite sides of things such as the left principles and the right policies.
万物恃之而生而不辞，功成不名有。 
All life depends on it to live. It never rejects nor refuses. It contributes, achieves, and offers but never takes the derived fame.
衣养万物而不为主，常无欲，可名于小。 
It nourishes all lives but never considers itself a governor. It always has no desires. We say it is 'tiny' because it positions itself as humbled.
万物归焉，而不为主，可名为大。 
All lives acknowledge its lead, but itself never recognize its dominance.  We say it is 'great' because of its real contribution.
以其终不自为大，故能成其大。 
Because it never claims to be great, it succeeds as significant.
