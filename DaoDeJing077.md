# 我来翻译道德经之077 -- Let me translate Dao De Jing to English 077

天之道，其犹张弓与？
The ultimate rule is like archery.
高者抑下，下者举之，有余者损之，不足者补之。
The high-positioned archer would hold the bow below than their chest, aiming at a lower point. The low-positioned would hold the bow up above their heads.
If pulling the bow-string too tight the archer will lose the force. If not strengthened enough more pull will be applied to shorten the gap.
天之道，损有余而补不足。
The ultimate rule functions in a similar way -- to let go of the exceeding and to amend the lacking.
人之道，则不然，损不足以奉有余。
The way of people's actions is the opposite -- to take away from the lacking but to add to the exceeding.
孰能有余以奉天下，唯有道者。
Who can use the exceeding portion to add to the lacking parts? Only the ones act according to the ultimate rule.
是以圣人为而不恃，功成而不处，其不欲见贤。
Therefore, the saints pursue achievements but never possess their accomplishments. They make great contributions but never give credit to themselves. Their virtue is revealed when they desire the beneficial outcomes.
